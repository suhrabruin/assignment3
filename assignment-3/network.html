          <p>
          A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on
          or provided by network nodes. The computers use common communication
          protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other.
          These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies,
          based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.
          </p>
          <p>
          The nodes of a computer network can include personal computers,
          servers, networking hardware, or other specialised or
          general-purpose hosts. They are identified by network
          addresses, and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as
          memorable labels for the nodes, rarely changed after initial assignment.
          Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by
          communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
          Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the
          transmission medium used to carry signals, bandwidth, communications
          protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology,
          traffic control mechanism, and organizational intent.

          <p>In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed
          electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while
          large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.
          The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical
          considerations including data modeling, efficient data representation
          and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data,
          and distributed computing issues including supporting concurrent access
          and fault tolerance.</p>
          <p>A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts
          with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture
          and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses
          the core facilities provided to administer the database.
          The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications
          can be referred to as a database system. Often the term "database"
          is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system
          or an application associated with the database.</p>
          <p>Computer scientists may classify database management systems according
          to the database models that they support. Relational databases became
          dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a
          series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and
          querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular,
          collectively referred to as NoSQL because they use different query
          languages.</p>
